This project discussed the concepts and applications of the hairy ball theorem. In meteorology, the the hairy ball theorem tells us that "there is no vanishing point on the earth".

Thank Dr. Travis Scrimshaw for helping me with SageMath coding questions. SageMath is an effective visualization tool for differential geometry.
