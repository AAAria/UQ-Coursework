# DATA7703 Machine Learning for Data Scientists

### Project: Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Forecasting

This project aims to predict the traffic volume on Metro Interstate with machine learning models. 

We performed data cleaning and pre-processing on Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

We built, optimized and compared models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Networks, and XGBoost. 

XGBoost which utilizes complicated weighting features and a combination of
two training models has the best outcome compared to other models.
